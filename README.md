## Problem

There are millions of people who looove dogs and would love to play with them or just hang out with a dog but are unable adopt any as a companion for various reasons such as lack of time, not having a suitable home for the dog, or financial inability.

Then there are those who are fortunate enough to have dog(s) but don't have enough time or are too tired to take them out for their daily exercise after coming home from work. Currently, these dog owners can solve this problem by hiring dog walkers or dog sitters for a fee which can get expensive over the long term.

## Solution

The solution for both of these groups is AirPupper! This app provides a platform for dogless dog-lovers to rent a dog for a fee set by the dog-owner.

The dog owners can upload pictures of their dogs and set a price per hour. The other users can go on the app and scroll through a list of dogs available and can "book" a dog through the app. Specific arrangements can be made between users through the app's internal messaging system.

With this app, the dogless people can hang out with a dog whenever they want without having to take care of one and dog owners don't have to pay through the nose to get their dog's daily exercise, but instead make some extra cash from it. This is the primary service of the app.

The secondary service is connecting dog owners to go on doggy dates. Dog owners can browse other dogs to "rent" for a few hours for own dog to have a companion to play with.
